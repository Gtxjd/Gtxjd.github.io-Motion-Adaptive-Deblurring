This folder constains the supplementary material for "Motion Adaptive Deblurring with Single-Photon Cameras."

"Supplement_WACV_2021_SPAD_Motion_Deblur.pdf" contains derivations of some of the fomulas used in the main text, CMOS images of the experimental scenes, and a few more SNR curves.

"fan_photon_frames.MP4" is a video of the raw timestamp data for the fan data set.

There are three folders: 
"Proposed Method Videos" contains video results of using our deblurring method.
"Long Exposure Videos" contains the result of doing a long exposure capture for each frame of video resulting in blur.
"Short Exposure Videos" contains the result of doing short exposure for each video frame resulting in noise. 

Each folder contains videos for the rotating orange scene and 2 experimental scenes.
